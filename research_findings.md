## Comprehensive CI/CD Best Practices (LaunchDarkly Guide)

Source: LaunchDarkly Ultimate Guide to CI/CD Best Practices

### Core Benefits of CI/CD:
- **Accelerated Software Delivery:** Automating build, test, and deployment processes for faster releases
- **Improved Code Quality:** Continuous integration catches bugs early and maintains high code quality
- **Better Collaboration:** Creates shared responsibility culture between development and operations teams
- **Fewer Deployment Risks:** Reduces risk through smaller, incremental changes and automated rollbacks
- **Faster Feedback Loops:** Automated testing and monitoring provide immediate feedback

### Detailed Best Practices:

#### 1. Commit Frequently
- Keep changes small, manageable, and easier to integrate
- Frequent, smaller commits minimize risk of large, complex merges
- Reduces likelihood of conflicts and bugs
- "Think big, act small" - deploy single changes at a time when possible
- Build shared knowledge and trust through small, frequent deployments

#### 2. Optimize Pipeline Stages
- Identify and eliminate bottlenecks using monitoring tools
- Run tasks in parallel (unit tests, integration tests, static analysis simultaneously)
- Monitor KPIs: build time, test duration, deployment frequency
- Cache and reuse build artifacts to save time
- Leverage available resources efficiently

#### 3. Build Code Artifacts Once
- Use same build artifacts across all environments (dev, test, staging, production)
- Maintains consistency and reduces duplication
- Eliminates discrepancies from multiple builds
- Store artifacts in centralized repository (JFrog Artifactory, Nexus)
- Keep artifacts immutable - changes trigger new builds
- Automate build processes for consistency

#### 4. Automate Tests
- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components/functions, fast execution
- **Integration Tests:** Verify components work together correctly
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate real user scenarios, validate entire workflow
- Prioritize faster tests early in pipeline
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible) for test environments
- Integrate with CI/CD platforms (Selenium, JUnit, TestNG)


#### 5. Keep Builds Fast and Simple
- Prioritize faster tests (unit tests) early in pipeline
- Make test results easily accessible with clear reporting and dashboards
- Use Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Ansible) for test environment setup
- Integrate automated testing tools (Selenium, JUnit, TestNG) with CI/CD platforms

#### 6. Use Shared Pipelines (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Centralized artifact repository using tools like JFrog Artifactory or Nexus Repository Manager
- Immutable artifacts - once built, remain unchanged; code changes trigger new builds
- Automated build processes using CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, AWS CodePipeline)
- Feature flags to decouple deployment from release

#### Security Considerations:
- **Important Quote:** "Automating your processes is great for efficiency, but it can introduce security risks, too. Get your security team involved from the start and use security scanning tools in your pipelines to keep everything safe." — Darrin Eden, Senior Software Engineer, LaunchDarkly

#### Performance Optimization:
- **Resource Management:** "Matching the workload to a correctly sized cluster of runners, both vertically and horizontally, guarantees efficient resource utilization and faster build times." — Darrin Eden
- **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage and optimize project dependencies and build configurations
- Unnecessary or outdated dependencies can slow down build times and introduce conflicts
- Review and update dependencies regularly using dependency management tools
- **Containerization:** "Containerizing the workflow, minimizing dependencies, and monitoring workflow velocity with alerts on performance drops can lead to more stable and faster builds." — Darrin Eden

#### Build Script Best Practices:
- Use straightforward and consistent build scripts
- Avoid overly complex configurations
- Speeds up builds and reduces likelihood of errors
- Makes it easier to update and manage build processes over time

### Popular CI/CD Tools Mentioned:
- **Artifact Repositories:** JFrog Artifactory, Nexus Repository Manager
- **CI/CD Platforms:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, AWS CodePipeline
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible
- **Testing Tools:** Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
- **Feature Management:** LaunchDarkly (for feature flags and deployment control)


## OWASP CI/CD Security Best Practices

### OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks:
1. **CICD-SEC-1:** Insufficient Flow Control Mechanisms
2. **CICD-SEC-2:** Inadequate Identity and Access Management
3. **CICD-SEC-3:** Dependency Chain Abuse
4. **CICD-SEC-4:** Poisoned Pipeline Execution (PPE)
5. **CICD-SEC-5:** Insufficient PBAC (Pipeline-Based Access Controls)
6. **CICD-SEC-6:** Insufficient Credential Hygiene
7. **CICD-SEC-7:** Insecure System Configuration
8. **CICD-SEC-8:** Ungoverned Usage of Third-Party Services
9. **CICD-SEC-9:** Improper Artifact Integrity Validation
10. **CICD-SEC-10:** Insufficient Logging and Visibility

### Key Security Principles:

#### Understanding CI/CD Risk:
- CI/CD increases organization's attack surface
- People, processes, and technology are all attack vectors
- Code repositories, automation servers (Jenkins), deployment procedures, and pipeline nodes can be exploited
- CI/CD steps often execute with high-privileged identities, increasing damage potential
- Examples: Codecov and SolarWinds breaches demonstrate potential impact

#### Secure Configuration Fundamentals:
- Never rely on default vendor settings
- Understand implications before adjusting settings
- Implement change management and governance
- Education is key before leveraging tools for critical operations
- Keep infrastructure patched and maintain asset inventory
- Harden systems according to CIS Benchmarks or STIGs

#### Secure SCM Configuration:
- Avoid auto-merge rules in platforms (GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket)
- Require pull request reviews before merging (cannot be bypassed)
- Leverage protected branches
- Require signed commits
- Carefully manage ephemeral contributors and external contributions
- Enable MFA where available
- Avoid default permissions for users and roles
- Restrict ability to fork private/internal repositories
- Limit option to change repository visibility to public

#### Pipeline and Execution Environment:
- Perform builds in appropriately isolated nodes
- Secure communication between SCM and CI/CD platform (TLS 1.2+)
- Restrict access to CI/CD environments by IP when possible
- Store CI config file outside repository when feasible
- Enable appropriate logging levels
- Incorporate SAST, DAST, IaC vulnerability scanning tools
- Require security testing before deployment
